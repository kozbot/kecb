# Where are the symbols?

They are generated in the ./dxf folder when the script is run.  I do not want the actual \*.dxf files to be included in the license and I believe this safely bypasses that.

# Design:

Symbols are drawn by default where 1 block = 20 units x 20 units = 1/8" x 1/8"

# Purpose:

This program is itended to bootstrap an electrical CAD symbol library by generating common symbols in .dxf format.
